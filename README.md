# Robot Simulator

A simple robot simulator that processes text commands to control a robot on a grid. The simulator supports commands like `PLACE`, `MOVE`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `REPORT`.

---

## Features

- Reads commands from a text file and executes them sequentially.
- Supports placing the robot at specific coordinates with a direction.
- Moves the robot on the grid while handling boundaries.
- Turns the robot left or right.
- Reports the robotâ€™s current position and direction.
- Ignores invalid commands gracefully.

---

## Design Overview

The project is structured following professional software engineering principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Parsing commands and executing them are handled by separate components.
- **Command Pattern**: Each command is represented as an immutable object implementing a `Command` interface.
- **Immutability & Value Objects**: Command objects encapsulate all required data and behavior and are immutable.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a clear and focused role.

---

## Benefits of this design

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  Parsing and execution logic are cleanly separated, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

- **Command Pattern**  
  Each command is represented as an immutable object implementing the `Command` interface. This makes it easy to add new commands and extend functionality without modifying existing code.

- **Immutability & Value Objects**  
  Commands like `PlaceCommand` are designed to be immutable value objects, encapsulating command data and behavior together.

- **Single Responsibility**  
  Each class has a clear responsibility:
    - `CommandProcessor` coordinates reading and processing commands.
    - `CommandParser` handles parsing and validation.
    - `CommandExecutor` handles command execution.
    - Command objects encapsulate the actions.

This design follows professional best practices and can easily be scaled or adapted for more complex command processing needs.

## Usage

1. Prepare a text file containing commands, one per line. Example:

PLACE,1,2,EAST
MOVE
LEFT
REPORT

2. Run the program and pass the command file as an argument.

## Example

$ java -jar robot-simulator.jar commands.txt
Output: 1,3,NORTH

## Project Structure

- `CommandProcessor`: Reads command input and manages processing.
- `CommandParser`: Parses command strings into command objects.
- `CommandExecutor`: Executes commands on the robot.
- Command classes (e.g., `PlaceCommand`, `MoveCommand`): Immutable objects implementing the `Command` interface.
- `Robot` interface and its implementation: Defines robot actions and state.

---

## Requirements

- Java 17+ (tested on OpenJDK 24)
- Maven (for building the project)

---

## Building

Use Maven to compile and package the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
Running Tests
The project includes JUnit 5 tests covering commands and robot behavior. Run tests with:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test
